# EMT-text-based-Game

Emergency Medical Technician Assessment Game
Experience a daily life of an EMT!
 
The purpose of this game is to give you an insight on what a day in the life of an EMT could possibly be. 
As you pick your path, depending on the choices you make, you get scored.
All responses are scored internally.
At the end you will receive an analysis based on your overall score which analyzes how good of an EMT 
you would be and whether or not you should take on that career path.
